 = EVENTS =

    - Events in the AppFile:

     - onAppLoaded | called when the entire app has loaded, and forms are ready to be created

     - onAppClosed | called right before the application is closed, the backend waits for this function to complete until it ends the process.

     - onFormActivated | called when the window created by the form gains focus

     - onFormDeactivated | called when the window created by the form looses focus

     - onFormLocationChanged | called when the location of the form has changed

      args: ((int) x, (int) y)

     - onFormSizeChanged | called when the size of the form has changed

      args: ((int) width, (int) height)

     - onConsoleMessage | called when a console message is logged (either an error/warning, or from a console.log called from the app)

      args: ((string) eventname, (int) linenumber, (string) message, (string) sourcefile)
